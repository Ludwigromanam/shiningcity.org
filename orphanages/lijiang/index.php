<h2>
	Lijiang Orphanage and Farm
</h2>
<p>
	Initial project engagement of SCF in Yunnan, Province started with support of the LiJiang Children's Ethnic Orphanage School. The first project was the purchase and installation of a water tank, solar panels, and shower facilities (piping) to provide the opportunity for over 300 youth to receive showers on site.
</p>
<p>
	This engagement led to major project support to enhance the living conditions at this site. In partnership with an Alumni Grant from Grinnell College, SCF provided the support and hands-on-engagement to build the first of three 3-building living complexes. This provided the opportunity for each youth to have their own bed rather than sleeping multiple youth to single beds.
</p>
<p>
	Support was also provided for the school to establish a self-sustaining farm operation through the purchase of pigs, cows, goats, chickens, ducks and fish. SCF also provided greenhouses for production of vegetables. This engagement enhanced the diet of the children and has continued to grow with management of the farm operation under the control of graduates from the school.
</p>
<p>
	Numerous enhancements have been financially supported including water purification, kitchen supplies, educational and recreational supplies.
