    <h2>Sichuan Province Orphanage</h2>
<p>
Sichuan Province Orphanage is a privately operated by a Christian doctor. Because of his years of service as a doctor in Tibetan areas, he has been entrusted with almost 50 orphans, most of them Tibetan children and many of them disabled. 
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the May 12 earthquake that shook southwest China last year, we were informed that the orphanage was in great need of emergency funds to continue operating. Although the orphanage buildings were safe, all roads to this remote mountain area were cut off by the earthquake, and the orphanage was in desperate need of extra money to buy flour, rice, and other stables that were suddenly in short supply and extremely expensive as everything had to be air-lifted in. The emergency funds that SCF supplied kept the children fed and healthy for those first critical months after the earthquake.
</p>
<p>
Many of the orphans have "special needs". Some of the children spend considerable time in hospitals in Chengdu (the nearest big city) for surgeries to correct or help the physical disabilities.
